# Personalised SEND Class Routine

The number of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) is increasing at an unprecedented rate, bringing with it a range of complex challenges. While there are many tools and strategies available to support these children, it is important to recognise that no two SEND children are the same. Each child requires a personalised curriculum tailored to their specific needs.

This becomes particularly challenging in classrooms where educators are responsible for supporting ten or more students with highly diverse learning profiles ranging from speech delay to severe autism.

# Objectives of this project
* effectively group students into sessions that best support their individual learning and developmental needs
* recommend tasks swiftly to facilitate quick, efficient and targeted planning for each child
